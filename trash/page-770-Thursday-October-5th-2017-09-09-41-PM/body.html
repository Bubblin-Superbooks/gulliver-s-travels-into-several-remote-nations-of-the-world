<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; For who can read of the virtues I have mentioned in the glorious Houyhnhnms, without being ashamed of his own vices, when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of his country?&nbsp; I shall say nothing of those remote nations where Yahoos preside; among which the least corrupted are the Brobdingnagians; whose wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to observe.&nbsp; But I forbear descanting further, and rather leave the judicious reader to his own remarks and application.</p><p>I am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with no censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer, who relates only plain facts, that happened in such distant countries, where we have not the least interest, with respect either to trade or negotiations?&nbsp; I have carefully avoided every fault with which common writers of travels are often too justly charged.</p></div> </div>
