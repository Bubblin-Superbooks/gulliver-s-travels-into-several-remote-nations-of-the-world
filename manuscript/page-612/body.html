<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.&nbsp; It happened, one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel nag, who was his valet.&nbsp; When he came I was fast asleep, my clothes fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist.&nbsp; I awaked at the noise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder; after which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very confused account of what he had seen.&nbsp; This I presently discovered, for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he asked me &ldquo;the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not the same thing when I slept, as I appeared to be at other times; that his vale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so white, and some brown.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
