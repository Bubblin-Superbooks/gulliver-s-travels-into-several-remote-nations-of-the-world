<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain, who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly.&nbsp; He came up to me, and after several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said, &ldquo;we should not die.&rdquo;&nbsp; I made the captain a very low bow, and then, turning to the Dutchman, said, &ldquo;I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen, than in a brother christian.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I had soon reason to repent those foolish words: for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to persuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which they would not yield to, after the promise made me that I should not die), however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me, worse, in all human appearance, than death itself.&nbsp; My men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned.</p></div> </div>
