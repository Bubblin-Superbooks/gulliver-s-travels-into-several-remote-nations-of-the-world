<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The town is capable of holding five hundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five stories: the shops and markets well provided.</p><p>The emperor&rsquo;s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great streets meet.&nbsp; It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet distance from the buildings.&nbsp; I had his majesty&rsquo;s permission to step over this wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the palace, I could easily view it on every side.&nbsp; The outward court is a square of forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide.</p></div> </div>
