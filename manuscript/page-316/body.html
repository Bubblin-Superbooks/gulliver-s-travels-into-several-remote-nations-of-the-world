<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse&rsquo;s footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.</p><p>I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.&nbsp; Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.&nbsp; The king, queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.&nbsp; The monkey was killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the palace.</p></div> </div>
