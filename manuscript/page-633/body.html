<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rdquo;&nbsp; Here my master interposed, by asking me, &ldquo;how I could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with me, after the losses I had sustained, and the hazards I had run?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.&nbsp; Some were undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring, and gaming; others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning, robbery, perjury, forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes, or sodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to their native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other places.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
