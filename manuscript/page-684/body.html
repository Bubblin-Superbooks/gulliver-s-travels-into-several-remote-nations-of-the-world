<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I did indeed observe that the Yahoos were the only animals in this country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than horses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.&nbsp; Neither has their language any more than a general appellation for those maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called hnea-yahoo, or Yahoo&rsquo;s evil; and the cure prescribed is a mixture of their own dung and urine, forcibly put down the Yahoo&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; This I have since often known to have been taken with success, and do here freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable specific against all diseases produced by repletion.</p></div> </div>
