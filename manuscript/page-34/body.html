<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes.&nbsp; I heard a confused noise about me; but in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky.&nbsp; In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.&nbsp; In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following the first.&nbsp; I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground.</p></div> </div>
