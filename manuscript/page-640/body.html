<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Neither are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so long a continuance, as those occasioned by difference in opinion, especially if it be in things indifferent.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them shall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend to any right.&nbsp; Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the other should quarrel with him.&nbsp; Sometimes a war is entered upon, because the enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak.&nbsp; Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us theirs.&nbsp; It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a country after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or embroiled by factions among themselves.</p></div> </div>
