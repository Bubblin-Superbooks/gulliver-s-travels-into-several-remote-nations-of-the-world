<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I stepped over the great western gate, and passed very gently, and sidling, through the two principal streets, only in my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts of my coat.&nbsp; I walked with the utmost circumspection, to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in the streets, although the orders were very strict, that all people should keep in their houses, at their own peril.&nbsp; The garret windows and tops of houses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels I had not seen a more populous place.&nbsp; The city is an exact square, each side of the wall being five hundred feet long.&nbsp; The two great streets, which run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide.&nbsp; The lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only view them as I passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches.</p></div> </div>
