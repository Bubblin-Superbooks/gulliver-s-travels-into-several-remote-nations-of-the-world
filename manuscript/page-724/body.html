<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I had worked two chairs with my knife, the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.&nbsp; When my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called nnuhnoh, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.&nbsp; Of these I also made very tolerable stockings.&nbsp; I soled my shoes with wood, which I cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was worn out, I supplied it with the skins of Yahoos dried in the sun.&nbsp; I often got honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my bread.&nbsp; No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, &ldquo;That nature is very easily satisfied;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;That necessity is the mother of invention.</p></div> </div>
