<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>During this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several times.&nbsp; I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced to fly their country.&nbsp; This labour took up several days&rsquo; conversation, before he was able to comprehend me.&nbsp; He was wholly at a loss to know what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices.&nbsp; To clear up which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and riches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy.&nbsp; All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making suppositions.&nbsp; After which, like one whose imagination was struck with something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with amazement and indignation.</p></div> </div>
