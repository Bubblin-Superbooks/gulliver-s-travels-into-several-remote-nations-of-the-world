<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> (for so I interpret the words quinbus flestrin,) &ldquo;after the strictest search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough to be a foot-cloth for your majesty&rsquo;s chief room of state.&nbsp; In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift.&nbsp; We desired it should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces set us both a sneezing for several times together.&nbsp; In his right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as the palm of our hands.</p></div> </div>
