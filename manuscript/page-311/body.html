<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The frog lay concealed till I was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.&nbsp; When the frog was got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious slime.&nbsp; The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived.&nbsp; However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone.&nbsp; I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the boat.</p><p>But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.</p></div> </div>
