<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The boy took me out in my box, about half an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.&nbsp; I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many a wistful melancholy look towards the sea.&nbsp; I found myself not very well, and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I hoped would do me good.&nbsp; I got in, and the boy shut the window close down, to keep out the cold.&nbsp; I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture is, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among the rocks to look for birds&rsquo; eggs, having before observed him from my window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.&nbsp; Be that as it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage.</p></div> </div>
