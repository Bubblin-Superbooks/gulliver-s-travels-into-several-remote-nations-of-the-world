<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.&nbsp; These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain.&nbsp; I ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk.&nbsp; It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in many parts of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to hard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had made how easily nature is satisfied.&nbsp; And I cannot but observe, that I never had one hours sickness while I stayed in this island.</p></div> </div>
