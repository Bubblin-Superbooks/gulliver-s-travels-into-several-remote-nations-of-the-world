<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of their flight.&nbsp; The horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times.&nbsp; I would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way, yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence.&nbsp; We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a strange horse.&nbsp; But this animal seemed to receive my civilities with disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right fore-foot to remove my hand.</p></div> </div>
