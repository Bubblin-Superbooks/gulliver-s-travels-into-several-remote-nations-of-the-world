<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The country described.&nbsp; A proposal for correcting modern maps.&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s palace; and some account of the metropolis.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s way of travelling.&nbsp; The chief temple described.</p><p>I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as far as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis.&nbsp; For the queen, whom I always attended, never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers.&nbsp; The whole extent of this prince&rsquo;s dominions reaches about six thousand miles in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence I cannot but conclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California;</p></div> </div>
