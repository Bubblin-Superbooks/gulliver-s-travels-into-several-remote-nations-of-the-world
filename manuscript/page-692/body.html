<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The author relates several particulars of the Yahoos.&nbsp; The great virtues of the Houyhnhnms.&nbsp; The education and exercise of their youth.&nbsp; Their general assembly.</p><p>As I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed it possible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character he gave of the Yahoos to myself and my countrymen; and I believed I could yet make further discoveries, from my own observation.&nbsp; I therefore often begged his honour to let me go among the herds of Yahoos in the neighbourhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being perfectly convinced that the hatred I bore these brutes would never suffer me to be corrupted by them; and his honour ordered one of his servants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and good-natured, to be my guard; without whose protection I durst not undertake such adventures.</p></div> </div>
