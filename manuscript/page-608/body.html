<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My master was eager to learn &ldquo;whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason, which I discovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth, which he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in learning and pronouncing their words and sentences.&rdquo;&nbsp; To help my memory, I formed all I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the words down, with the translations.&nbsp; This last, after some time, I ventured to do in my master&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; It cost me much trouble to explain to him what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or literature.</p><p>In about ten weeks time, I was able to understand most of his questions; and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.</p></div> </div>
