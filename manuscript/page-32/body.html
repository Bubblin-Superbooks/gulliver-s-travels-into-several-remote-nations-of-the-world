<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; We rowed, by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship.&nbsp; We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north.&nbsp; What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost.&nbsp; For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide.&nbsp; I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was much abated.&nbsp; The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening.</p></div> </div>
