<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.&nbsp; Here I walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.&nbsp; I was an hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude.&nbsp; There was a stile to pass from this field into the next.&nbsp; It had four steps, and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost.&nbsp; It was impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about twenty.</p></div> </div>
