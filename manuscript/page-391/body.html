<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.&nbsp; But meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we sailed southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course west-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of Good Hope.&nbsp; Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the reader with a journal of it.&nbsp; The captain called in at one or two ports, and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water; but I never went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape.&nbsp; I offered to leave my goods in security for payment of my freight: but the captain protested he would not receive one farthing.</p></div> </div>
