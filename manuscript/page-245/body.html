<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be near three hundred feet square.&nbsp; My little nurse stood on a low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do.&nbsp; My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to see me.&nbsp; I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me questions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached, and I answered them as loud as I could.&nbsp; I turned about several times to the company, paid my humble respects, said they were welcome, and used some other speeches I had been taught.&nbsp; I took up a thimble filled with liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of fencers in England.</p></div> </div>
