<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave Blefuscu; and, after some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.</p><p>Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea, somewhat that looked like a boat overturned.&nbsp; I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the object to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship.&nbsp; Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the command of his vice-admiral.&nbsp; This fleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat.</p></div> </div>
