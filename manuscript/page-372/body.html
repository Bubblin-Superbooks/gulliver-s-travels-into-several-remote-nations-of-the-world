<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A breach in one single pane of glass would have been immediate death: nor could any thing have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the outside, against accidents in travelling.&nbsp; I saw the water ooze in at several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I endeavoured to stop them as well as I could.&nbsp; I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold.&nbsp; Or if I escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a miserable death of cold and hunger?&nbsp; I was four hours under these circumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my last.</p></div> </div>
