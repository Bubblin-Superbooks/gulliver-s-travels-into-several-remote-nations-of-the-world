<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in diameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is therefore called flandona gagnole, or the astronomer&rsquo;s cave, situated at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant.&nbsp; In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which, from the reflection of the adamant, cast a strong light into every part.&nbsp; The place is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes, astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.&nbsp; But the greatest curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver&rsquo;s shuttle.&nbsp; It is in length six yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over.</p></div> </div>
