<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; At last I beheld several animals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees.&nbsp; Their shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better.&nbsp; Some of them coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking their form.&nbsp; Their heads and breasts were covered with a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats, and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see their skins, which were of a brown buff colour.&nbsp;</p></div> </div>
