<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business, or a visit.&nbsp; The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.&nbsp; As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.</p></div> </div>
