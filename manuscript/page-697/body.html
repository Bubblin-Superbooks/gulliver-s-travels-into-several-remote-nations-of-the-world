<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Being one day abroad with my protector the sorrel nag, and the weather exceeding hot, I entreated him to let me bathe in a river that was near.&nbsp; He consented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked, and went down softly into the stream.&nbsp; It happened that a young female Yahoo, standing behind a bank, saw the whole proceeding, and inflamed by desire, as the nag and I conjectured, came running with all speed, and leaped into the water, within five yards of the place where I bathed.&nbsp; I was never in my life so terribly frightened.&nbsp; The nag was grazing at some distance, not suspecting any harm.&nbsp; She embraced me after a most fulsome manner.&nbsp; I roared as loud as I could, and the nag came galloping towards me, whereupon she quitted her grasp, with the utmost reluctancy, and leaped upon the opposite bank, where she stood gazing and howling all the time I was putting on my clothes.</p></div> </div>
