<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling, two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.&nbsp; And having been long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.</p><p>Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by two others in the queen&rsquo;s livery.&nbsp; The people, who had often heard of me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand, that I might be more conveniently seen.</p></div> </div>
