<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A description of the farmer&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; The author carried to a market-town, and then to the metropolis.&nbsp; The particulars of his journey.</p><p>My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts for her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her baby.&nbsp; Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby&rsquo;s cradle for me against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.&nbsp; This was my bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.&nbsp; This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself.</p></div> </div>
