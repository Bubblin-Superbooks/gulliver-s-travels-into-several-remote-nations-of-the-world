<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A further account of Glubbdubdrib.&nbsp; Ancient and modern history corrected.</p><p>Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and learning, I set apart one day on purpose.&nbsp; I proposed that Homer and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court, and outward rooms of the palace.&nbsp; I knew, and could distinguish those two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.&nbsp; Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever beheld.&nbsp; Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff.&nbsp; His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow.</p></div> </div>
