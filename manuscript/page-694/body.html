<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>They are prodigiously nimble from their infancy.&nbsp; However, I once caught a young male of three years old, and endeavoured, by all marks of tenderness, to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a squalling, and scratching, and biting with such violence, that I was forced to let it go; and it was high time, for a whole troop of old ones came about us at the noise, but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran), and my sorrel nag being by, they durst not venture near us.&nbsp; I observed the young animal&rsquo;s flesh to smell very rank, and the stink was somewhat between a weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.&nbsp; I forgot another circumstance (and perhaps I might have the reader&rsquo;s pardon if it were wholly omitted), that while I held the odious vermin in my hands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my clothes;</p></div> </div>
