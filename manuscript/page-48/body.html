<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the greatest engine they had.&nbsp; It was a frame of wood raised three inches from the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels.&nbsp; The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this engine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing.&nbsp; It was brought parallel to me, as I lay.&nbsp; But the principal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle.&nbsp; Eighty poles, each of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs.</p></div> </div>
