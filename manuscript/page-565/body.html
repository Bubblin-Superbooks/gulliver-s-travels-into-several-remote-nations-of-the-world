<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long and troublesome journey.&nbsp; I soon fell into the company of some Dutch sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons.&nbsp; I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke Dutch well.&nbsp; The seamen soon knew whence I came last: they were curious to inquire into my voyages and course of life.&nbsp; I made up a story as short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part.&nbsp; I knew many persons in Holland.&nbsp; I was able to invent names for my parents, whom I pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland.&nbsp; I would have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve him in the way of my calling.</p></div> </div>
