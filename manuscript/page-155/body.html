<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired &ldquo;that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of the blood of both sexes, might have the happiness,&rdquo; as he was pleased to call it, &ldquo;of dining with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; They came accordingly, and I placed them in chairs of state, upon my table, just over against me, with their guards about them.&nbsp; Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his white staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual, in honour to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with admiration.&nbsp; I have some private reasons to believe, that this visit from his majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his master.</p></div> </div>
