<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the Houyhnhnms; and these not confined to particular objects, but universal to the whole race; for a stranger from the remotest part is equally treated with the nearest neighbour, and wherever he goes, looks upon himself as at home.&nbsp; They preserve decency and civility in the highest degrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony.&nbsp; They have no fondness for their colts or foals, but the care they take in educating them proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason.&nbsp; And I observed my master to show the same affection to his neighbour&rsquo;s issue, that he had for his own.&nbsp; They will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole species, and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons, where there is a superior degree of virtue.</p></div> </div>
