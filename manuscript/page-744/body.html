<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My master and his friends continued on the shore till I was almost out of sight; and I often heard the sorrel nag (who always loved me) crying out, &ldquo;Hnuy illa nyha, majah Yahoo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Take care of thyself, gentle Yahoo.&rdquo;</p><p>My design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited, yet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of life, which I would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister in the politest court of Europe; so horrible was the idea I conceived of returning to live in the society, and under the government of Yahoos.&nbsp; For in such a solitude as I desired, I could at least enjoy my own thoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable Houyhnhnms, without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and corruptions of my own species.</p></div> </div>
