<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Houyhnhnms keep the Yahoos for present use in huts not far from the house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they dig up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion, or sometimes catch weasels and luhimuhs (a sort of wild rat), which they greedily devour.&nbsp; Nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their nails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by themselves; only the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to hold two or three cubs.</p><p>They swim from their infancy like frogs, and are able to continue long under water, where they often take fish, which the females carry home to their young.&nbsp; And, upon this occasion, I hope the reader will pardon my relating an odd adventure.</p></div> </div>
