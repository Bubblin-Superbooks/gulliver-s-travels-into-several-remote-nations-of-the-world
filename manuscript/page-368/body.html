<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious speed.&nbsp; The first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough.&nbsp; I called out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no purpose.&nbsp; I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the clouds and sky.&nbsp; I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body, and devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to discover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I could be within a two-inch board.</p></div> </div>
