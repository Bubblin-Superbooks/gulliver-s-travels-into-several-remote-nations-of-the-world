<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The author&rsquo;s veracity.&nbsp; His design in publishing this work.&nbsp; His censure of those travellers who swerve from the truth.&nbsp; The author clears himself from any sinister ends in writing.&nbsp; An objection answered.&nbsp; The method of planting colonies.&nbsp; His native country commended.&nbsp; The right of the crown to those countries described by the author is justified.&nbsp; The difficulty of conquering them.&nbsp; The author takes his last leave of the reader; proposes his manner of living for the future; gives good advice, and concludes.</p><p>Thus, gentle reader, I have given thee a faithful history of my travels for sixteen years and above seven months: wherein I have not been so studious of ornament as of truth.&nbsp; I could, perhaps, like others, have astonished thee with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to relate plain matter of fact, in the simplest manner and style; because my principal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.</p></div> </div>
