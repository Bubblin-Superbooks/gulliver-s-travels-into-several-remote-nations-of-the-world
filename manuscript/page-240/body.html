<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Another farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.&nbsp; I was immediately produced, and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my master&rsquo;s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him he was welcome, just as my little nurse had instructed me.&nbsp; This man, who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better; at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows.&nbsp; Our people, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance.</p></div> </div>
