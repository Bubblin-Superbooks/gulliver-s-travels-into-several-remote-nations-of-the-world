<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My eldest uncle John had left me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a-year; and I had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter-Lane, which yielded me as much more; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon the parish.&nbsp; My son Johnny, named so after his uncle, was at the grammar-school, and a towardly child.&nbsp; My daughter Betty (who is now well married, and has children) was then at her needle-work.&nbsp; I took leave of my wife, and boy and girl, with tears on both sides, and went on board the Adventure, a merchant ship of three hundred tons, bound for Surat, captain John Nicholas, of Liverpool, commander.&nbsp; But my account of this voyage must be referred to the Second Part of my Travels.</p></div> </div>
