<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the king&rsquo;s order, attended by a flapper.&nbsp; He brought with him pen, ink, and paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he was sent to teach me the language.&nbsp; We sat together four hours, in which time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the translations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk, and the like.&nbsp; Then I took down the sentence in writing.&nbsp; He showed me also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations of many plains and solids.</p></div> </div>
