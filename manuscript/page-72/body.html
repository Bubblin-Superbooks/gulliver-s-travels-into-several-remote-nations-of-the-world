<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly lift them.&nbsp; In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of his pocket.&nbsp; One of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our heads.&nbsp; Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines.&nbsp; He took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other.</p></div> </div>
