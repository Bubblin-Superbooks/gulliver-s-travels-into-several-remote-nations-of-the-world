<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I roused myself, and looked about me in the room where I was left alone: this was furnished like the first, only after a more elegant manner.&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes often, but the same objects still occurred.&nbsp; I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself, hoping I might be in a dream.&nbsp; I then absolutely concluded, that all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.&nbsp; But I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and clean.</p><p>The mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close, after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most contemptuous look;</p></div> </div>
