<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I was afraid of venturing far into the country.&nbsp; I found some shellfish on the shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of being discovered by the natives.&nbsp; I continued three days feeding on oysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found a brook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.</p><p>On the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty or thirty natives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me.&nbsp; They were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a fire, as I could discover by the smoke.&nbsp; One of them spied me, and gave notice to the rest; five of them advanced toward me, leaving the women and children at the fire.</p></div> </div>
