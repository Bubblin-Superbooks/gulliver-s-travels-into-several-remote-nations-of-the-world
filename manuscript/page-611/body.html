<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Several horses and mares of quality in the neighbourhood came often to our house, upon the report spread of &ldquo;a wonderful Yahoo, that could speak like a Houyhnhnm, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some glimmerings of reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; These delighted to converse with me: they put many questions, and received such answers as I was able to return.&nbsp; By all these advantages I made so great a progress, that, in five months from my arrival I understood whatever was spoken, and could express myself tolerably well.</p><p>The Houyhnhnms, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right Yahoo, because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.&nbsp; They were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on my head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon an accident which happened about a fortnight before.</p></div> </div>
