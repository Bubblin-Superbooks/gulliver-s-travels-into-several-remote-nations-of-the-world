<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There was the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king&rsquo;s beard, and another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty&rsquo;s thumb-nail, which served for the back.&nbsp; There was a collection of needles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like joiner&rsquo;s tacks; some combings of the queen&rsquo;s hair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar.&nbsp; I desired the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his civilities; which he absolutely refused.&nbsp; I showed him a corn that I had cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour&rsquo;s toe; it was about the bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.</p></div> </div>
