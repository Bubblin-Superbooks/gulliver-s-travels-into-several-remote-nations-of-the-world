<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Besides, I meddle not the least with any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or ill-will against any man, or number of men, whatsoever.&nbsp; I write for the noblest end, to inform and instruct mankind; over whom I may, without breach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from the advantages I received by conversing so long among the most accomplished Houyhnhnms.&nbsp; I write without any view to profit or praise.&nbsp; I never suffer a word to pass that may look like reflection, or possibly give the least offence, even to those who are most ready to take it.&nbsp; So that I hope I may with justice pronounce myself an author perfectly blameless; against whom the tribes of Answerers, Considerers, Observers, Reflectors, Detectors, Remarkers, will never be able to find matter for exercising their talents.</p></div> </div>
