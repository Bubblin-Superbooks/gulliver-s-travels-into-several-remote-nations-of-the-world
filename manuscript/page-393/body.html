<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My wife run out to embrace me, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be able to reach my mouth.&nbsp; My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her up with one hand by the waist.&nbsp; I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and I a giant.&nbsp; I told my wife, &ldquo;she had been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain&rsquo;s opinion when he first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits.&nbsp; This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice.</p></div> </div>
