<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage, which was very prosperous for the most part.&nbsp; We arrived in the Downs on the 13th of April, 1702.&nbsp; I had only one misfortune, that the rats on board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked clean from the flesh.&nbsp; The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food.</p></div> </div>
