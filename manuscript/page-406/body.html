<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not reach it in less than five hours.&nbsp; I encompassed it almost round, before I could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek, about three times the wideness of my canoe.&nbsp; I found the island to be all rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling herbs.&nbsp; I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself, I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel, match, and burning-glass.&nbsp; I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my provisions.&nbsp; My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I intended for fuel.</p></div> </div>
