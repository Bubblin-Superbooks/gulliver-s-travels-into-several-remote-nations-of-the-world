<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; For example, if my neighbour has a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow from me.&nbsp; I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself.&nbsp; Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner, lie under two great disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practised almost from his cradle in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an advocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will.&nbsp; The second disadvantage is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else he will be reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that would lessen the practice of the law.&nbsp; And therefore I have but two methods to preserve my cow.</p></div> </div>
