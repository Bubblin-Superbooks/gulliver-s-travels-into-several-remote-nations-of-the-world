<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him.&nbsp; She carried me on her lap, in a box tied about her waist.&nbsp; The girl had lined it on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her baby&rsquo;s bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could.&nbsp; We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.</p><p>My master&rsquo;s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or person of quality&rsquo;s house, where he might expect custom.&nbsp; We made easy journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the trotting of the horse.</p></div> </div>
