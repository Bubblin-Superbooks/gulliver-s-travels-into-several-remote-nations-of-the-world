<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land.&nbsp; By an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes south.&nbsp; Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food; the rest were in a very weak condition.&nbsp; On the 5th of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within half a cable&rsquo;s length of the ship; but the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately split.&nbsp; Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock.</p></div> </div>
