<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth, are provided with grave and learned professors, and their several deputies.&nbsp; The clothes and food of the children are plain and simple.&nbsp; They are bred up in the principles of honour, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion, and love of their country; they are always employed in some business, except in the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours for diversions consisting of bodily exercises.&nbsp; They are dressed by men till four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves, although their quality be ever so great; and the women attendant, who are aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial offices.&nbsp; They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go together in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions, and always in the presence of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice, to which our children are subject.</p></div> </div>
