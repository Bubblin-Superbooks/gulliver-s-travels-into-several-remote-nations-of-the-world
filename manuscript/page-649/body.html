<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The first is, to gain over my adversary&rsquo;s lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating that he hath justice on his side.&nbsp; The second way is for my lawyer to make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong to my adversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly bespeak the favour of the bench.&nbsp; Now your honour is to know, that these judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property, as well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most dexterous lawyers, who are grown old or lazy; and having been biassed all their lives against truth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of favouring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure the faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.</p></div> </div>
