<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I communicated to his majesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy&rsquo;s whole fleet; which, as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to sail with the first fair wind.&nbsp; I consulted the most experienced seamen upon the depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that in the middle, at high-water, it was seventy glumgluffs deep, which is about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty glumgluffs at most.&nbsp; I walked towards the north-east coast, over against Blefuscu, where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective glass, and viewed the enemy&rsquo;s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty men of war, and a great number of transports: I then came back to my house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron.</p></div> </div>
