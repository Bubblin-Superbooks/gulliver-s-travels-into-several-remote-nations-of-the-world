<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The bed was eight yards from the floor.&nbsp; Some natural necessities required me to get down; I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family kept.&nbsp; While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed.&nbsp; One of them came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself.&nbsp; These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.</p></div> </div>
