<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions.&nbsp; But those objects against which their envy seems principally directed, are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old.&nbsp; By reflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope to arrive.&nbsp; They have no remembrance of anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and middle-age, and even that is very imperfect; and for the truth or particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than upon their best recollections.&nbsp; The least miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet with more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which abound in others.</p></div> </div>
