<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.&nbsp; A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.&nbsp; The room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt, when I went in a coach.&nbsp; I desired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and mice from coming in.&nbsp; The smith, after several attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a gentleman&rsquo;s house in England.&nbsp; I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might lose it.</p></div> </div>
