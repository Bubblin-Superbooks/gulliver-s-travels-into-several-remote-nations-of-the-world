<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A further account of the academy.&nbsp; The author proposes some improvements, which are honourably received.</p><p>In the school of political projectors, I was but ill entertained; the professors appearing, in my judgment, wholly out of their senses, which is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy.&nbsp; These unhappy people were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to consult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, eminent services; of instructing princes to know their true interest, by placing it on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for employments persons qualified to exercise them, with many other wild, impossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man to conceive; and confirmed in me the old observation, &ldquo;that there is nothing so extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not maintained for truth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
