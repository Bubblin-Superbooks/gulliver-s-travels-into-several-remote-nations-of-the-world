<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I laid in a stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls, and took with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.</p><p>I tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master&rsquo;s house, and then corrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with Yahoos&rsquo; tallow, till I found it staunch, and able to bear me and my freight; and, when it was as complete as I could possibly make it, I had it drawn on a carriage very gently by Yahoos to the sea-side, under the conduct of the sorrel nag and another servant.</p><p>When all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of my master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my heart quite sunk with grief.</p></div> </div>
