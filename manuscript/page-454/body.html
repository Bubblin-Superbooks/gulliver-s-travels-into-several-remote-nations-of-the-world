<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying island, passes under the general name of Balnibarbi; and the metropolis, as I said before, is called Lagado.&nbsp; I felt some little satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground.&nbsp; I walked to the city without any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently instructed to converse with them.&nbsp; I soon found out the person&rsquo;s house to whom I was recommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee in the island, and was received with much kindness.&nbsp; This great lord, whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I continued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable manner.</p></div> </div>
