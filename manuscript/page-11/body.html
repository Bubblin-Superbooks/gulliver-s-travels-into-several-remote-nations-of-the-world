<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages, together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied.&nbsp; But I was resolved to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of readers.&nbsp; However, if my own ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them.&nbsp; And if any traveller hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came from the hands of the author, I will be ready to gratify him.</p></div> </div>
