<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple, esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the zeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been applied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried away.&nbsp; In this edifice it was determined I should lodge.&nbsp; The great gate fronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide, through which I could easily creep.&nbsp; On each side of the gate was a small window, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side, the king&rsquo;s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that hang to a lady&rsquo;s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.</p></div> </div>
