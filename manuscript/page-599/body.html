<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a sledge by four Yahoos.&nbsp; There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident got a hurt in his left fore-foot.&nbsp; He came to dine with our horse, who received him with great civility.&nbsp; They dined in the best room, and had oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm, but the rest cold.&nbsp; Their mangers were placed circular in the middle of the room, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on their haunches, upon bosses of straw.&nbsp; In the middle was a large rack, with angles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk, with much decency and regularity.</p></div> </div>
