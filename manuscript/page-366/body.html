<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When we came to our journey&rsquo;s end, the king thought proper to pass a few days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen English miles of the seaside.&nbsp; Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to her chamber.&nbsp; I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of my escape, if ever it should happen.&nbsp; I pretended to be worse than I really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a page, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with me.&nbsp; I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch consented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me, bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some forboding of what was to happen.</p></div> </div>
